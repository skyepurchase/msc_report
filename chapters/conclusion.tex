\section{Limitations}

The primary limitation of the project is using GPT-2 which has a limited context window and ability for high-level reasoning.
This means that the results of this project will not necessarily scale to modern LLMs such as Gemma, GPT-4, Llama-3, etc.
Though the results do demonstrate how steering adaptors behave in a natural language setting there is still more work to be done on quantitative analysis of steering adaptors.

Further limitations include the adaptors chosen.
The adaptors presented in this work are chosen to represent a range of steering adaptors currently proposed, however, there are many more techniques that would behave differently.
Clear examples include minimally modified counterfactuals \citep{mimic} which was used in \citet{steering-clear} and probes \citep{probes}.
This project already demonstrates the wide performance range of the few commonly used adaptors, analysing the performance of more adaptors would give a better overview of represenation engineering as a whole.

Finally the datasets used are small, both in the number of examples and in the number of distinct sets.
Only 5 different sets were used to generate the results in \Sref{sec:steering-clear-res} each with at most 3000 unique prompts.
This fails to completely capture the full range of representations that the model may contain.
Considering that the sparse autoencoder dimension for GPT-2 is 24576 \citep{saelens} 5 datasets are unlikely to encompass all concepts present in the model representation.
