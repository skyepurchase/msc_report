\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I want to thank my family, especially my mum and dad who have supported me throughout my life and encouraged me to explore the world.
To my wider family who have both directly and indirectly supported me throughout the masters.

Particular thanks goes to Mia who has supported me throughout the highs and lows, stress and anxiety of the masters and the year leading up to it.
Thank you for listening to my endless rambles about the project and all the other projects I've had; keeping me focused, motivated, and on track to complete the thesis.

I would like to thank my supervisor Daniel Tan and the support of the ML Alignment and Theory Scholars London office for guiding the project and providing feedback along the way.
Additionally, to Alex for providing detailed, actionable feedback on my early rough drafts.
